            <h3>Policy Disclosure Statement</h3>
            <p>
                This Policy Disclosure Statement provides important information about the Student Indemnity
                Insurance (the "Policy") offered by Aegis. It is not the policy wording. The information below is a
                summary to help you decide whether the Policy meets your needs. Full terms, conditions, limits and
                exclusions are set out in the Policy document.
            </p>

            <h4>Insurer and intermediary</h4>
            <p>
                The Policy is underwritten by a licensed insurer and distributed by Aegis. Aegis acts as an authorised
                representative/broker where applicable and can provide general advice about the Product. We will
                disclose the insurer name and contact details on application and in the policy schedule.
            </p>

            <h4>What is covered</h4>
            <p>
                Subject to the Policy terms and limits, cover may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Liability for civil claims arising from alleged errors, omissions or negligent acts in the course of
                    placement or supervised practice</li>
                <li>Legal defence costs and expenses (which may erode the sum insured depending on the Policy
                    wording)</li>
                <li>Costs awarded against you by a court or tribunal</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What is not covered</h4>
            <p>
                Typical exclusions include intentional wrongdoing, criminal acts, matters arising from activities not
                authorised by the placement supervisor, professional work carried out outside the scope of training,
                and claims for bodily injury where a workers' compensation scheme applies instead. Specific
                exclusions will be listed in the Policy wording.
            </p>

            <h4>Limits, deductibles and conditions</h4>
            <p>
                The Policy will specify the limit(s) of indemnity, any sub-limits and the deductibles that apply to
                a claim. Some cover sections may be subject to different limits. There may be conditions precedent to
                cover such as notification requirements, supervision requirements, and co-operation with the insurer
                during claims handling.
            </p>

            <h4>Claims handling and notification</h4>
            <p>
                You must notify Aegis or the insurer as soon as you become aware of any circumstance or claim that
                may give rise to a claim. Late notification may affect cover. The insurer will manage claims in
                accordance with regulatory obligations and will engage lawyers or experts as required.
            </p>

            <h4>How to apply and payment</h4>
            <p>
                Applications can be made online or through your education provider. Premiums are payable on the
                schedule and may vary depending on the placement type, student discipline, jurisdiction and limits
                selected. Group arrangements are available for institutions.
            </p>

            <h4>Cooling-off and renewal</h4>
            <p>
                You may have a short cooling-off period after taking out the Policy during which you can cancel for a
                refund, subject to conditions. Renewal terms will be notified prior to expiry and a new schedule will
                be provided on renewal.
            </p>

            <h4>Complaints and dispute resolution</h4>
            <p>
                If you have a complaint about the product or claims handling, contact Aegis Customer Support. If you
                remain dissatisfied, you may refer the complaint to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority
                (AFCA) where eligible.
