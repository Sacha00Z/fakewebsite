            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="muted">Last updated: 1 February 2026</p>

            <article class="policy">
                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Aegis ("we", "us", "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who interact with
                    our business. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, store and disclose personal
                    information
                    in connection with our insurance and financial services in Australia. It is designed to meet our
                    obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), and to
                    reflect sound practice for the insurance sector.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    This policy applies to personal information we collect about customers, claimants, prospective
                    customers, policyholders, agents, brokers, suppliers and website visitors. It covers personal
                    information obtained in person, on the phone, via our website, by email, and from third parties.
                </p>

                <h3>3. What information we collect</h3>
                <p>
                    We collect the kinds of personal information reasonably necessary for our business, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identity and contact information (name, address, email, telephone).</li>
                    <li>Verification information (date of birth, driver licence, passport, tax file number where
                        required).</li>
                    <li>Insurance-related information (policy details, payment and claims history, risk and
                        underwriting information).</li>
                    <li>Sensitive information where required for underwriting and claims (health information, medical
                        reports, criminal records) — we will only collect this where necessary and with appropriate
                        consent or legal basis.</li>
                    <li>Financial information (bank account details, credit card details, income and employment
                        details, credit information from credit reporting bodies).</li>
                    <li>Interaction data (communications, call recordings, notes, preferences and feedback).</li>
                    <li>Device and usage data from our website including cookies, IP addresses, and analytics data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. How we collect information</h3>
                <p>
                    We collect personal information directly from you (for example, when you complete an application,
                    make a claim or contact us). We may also collect information from third parties such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Agents, brokers and intermediaries;</li>

                    <li>Credit reporting bodies and identity verification services;</li>
                    <li>Other insurers, reinsurers and investigators (e.g. fraud checks); and</li>
                    <li>Service providers who assist us with administration, IT, hosting, analytics and marketing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Purposes of collection and legal basis</h3>
                <p>
                    We collect and use personal information to provide and administer our products and services, which
                    may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assessing eligibility and underwriting risks;</li>
                    <li>Processing applications, policies, claims and payments;</li>
                    <li>Detecting and preventing fraud and other unlawful activity;</li>
                    <li>Meeting regulatory and reporting obligations (including to APRA and ASIC where applicable);</li>
                    <li>Improving our products, services and customer experience;</li>
                    <li>Conducting research, analytics and trend reporting on an aggregated or de-identified basis;</li>
                    <li>Direct marketing where you have consented or where permitted by law; and</li>
                    <li>Operational purposes such as IT support, administration and risk management.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Where we collect sensitive information (for example health information needed to process a claim)
                    we will take reasonable steps to obtain your consent or rely on another lawful basis permitted by
                    the Privacy Act.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Disclosure and third parties</h3>
                <p>
                    We may disclose personal information to third parties where necessary for the purposes described
                    above. Typical recipients include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insurers, reinsurers and brokers;</li>
                    <li>Claims handlers, loss adjusters, investigators and legal advisors;</li>
                    <li>Medical and other health professionals for claims assessment;</li>
                    <li>Service providers who host systems, provide analytics, payments or customer support;</li>
                    <li>Government agencies, law enforcement or regulators where required by law; and</li>
                    <li>Other parties with your consent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We require our service providers to handle personal information in accordance with this policy and
                    applicable law. Where we engage overseas service providers, we will take reasonable steps to ensure
                    adequate protection of personal information (see below).
                </p>

                <h3>7. Overseas disclosures</h3>
                <p>
                    Some of our service providers may be located overseas or may transfer data to third parties in other
                    jurisdictions (including for IT hosting and analytics). Where personal information is disclosed
                    overseas we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient handles the information in a
                    way that complies with the APPs, or we will obtain your consent. If you would like details of the
                    countries where overseas recipients are likely to be located, contact our Privacy Officer (details
                    below).
                </p>

                <h3>8. Security</h3>
                <p>
                    We take reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse, interference, loss and
                    unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. These steps include physical, technical and
                    administrative safeguards such as access controls, encryption, network monitoring, secure
                    disposal policies and staff training.
                </p>

                <h3>9. Retention</h3>
                <p>
                    We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was
                    collected and to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. Retention periods vary depending on the
                    type of information and legal requirements (for example insurance-related records are generally kept
                    for several years after a policy expires or a claim is finalised).
                </p>

                <h3>10. Access and correction</h3>
                <p>
                    You may request access to the personal information we hold about you and request corrections if it
                    is inaccurate. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period and may charge a small fee
                    for retrieval or copying where permitted by law. We may refuse access in certain circumstances set
                    out in the Privacy Act, and will provide reasons for any refusal.
                </p>

                <h3>11. Complaints</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have a complaint about a breach of your privacy, please contact our Privacy Officer using the
                    details below. We will investigate and respond within a reasonable timeframe. If you remain
                    dissatisfied you may refer the matter to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner
                    (OAIC).
                </p>

                <h3>12. Cookies and online tracking</h3>

                    Our website uses cookies and similar technologies to collect information about how visitors use our

                <h3>13. Marketing</h3>
                <p>
                    We may use your personal information to send you marketing communications about products and
                    services we think may be of interest. You can opt out of marketing at any time by following the
                    unsubscribe link in the communication or by contacting us.
                </p>

                <h3>14. Changes to this policy</h3>
                <p>
                    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted on this
                    page with an updated "Last updated" date. Significant changes will be communicated to existing
                    customers where appropriate.
                </p>

                <h3>16. Additional information for insurance customers</h3>
                <p>
                    For insurance products, we may also need to collect additional information to comply with legal
                    and regulatory obligations, including fraud prevention, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism
                    financing checks, which may involve the use of public and government databases and disclosure to
                    regulators. In some circumstances, failure to provide required information may result in declined
                    applications, reduced cover or the inability to process claims.
                </p>

                <p class="muted small">This Privacy Policy is a general statement of our practices and does not form
