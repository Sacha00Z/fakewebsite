            <h3 id="aegis-group-constitution">Aegis Group Constitution</h3>
            <p>
                By applying for membership or insurance with Aegis, applicants agree to be bound by the Aegis Group
                Constitution. The Constitution sets out membership criteria, governance arrangements, dispute
                resolution procedures and the mutual obligations of members and the Group. A condensed version is
                provided below for information purposes.
            </p>

            <article class="constitution">
                <h4>Preamble</h4>
                <p>
                    Aegis is established to provide collective protection and support to its members, promote best
                    practice in professional conduct, and to ensure the continuity of mutual insurance benefits for the
                    membership community.
                </p>

                <h4>1. Membership</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Membership is open to individuals and institutions engaged in professional education or practice
                        who meet enrollment and conduct requirements set by the Board.</li>
                    <li>Members shall pay membership fees and premiums as determined by the Board and agreed in the
                        membership schedule.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. Governance</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Group is governed by a Board of Directors elected by members, responsible for strategy,
                        financial oversight and appointment of executive officers.</li>
                    <li>The Board will establish committees for audit, risk, and member engagement as required.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>3. Financial Management</h4>
                <p>
                    The Group will maintain prudent reserves, actuarial oversight for insurance liabilities, and annual
                    reporting to members. Surplus and deficit allocation principles will be published and applied in
                    accordance with applicable law.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <p>
                    Members agree to use internal dispute resolution procedures before pursuing external remedies. The
                    Constitution sets timelines for responses and escalation to independent external bodies such as
                    AFCA when eligible.
                </p>

                <h4>5. Amendments</h4>
                <p>
                    The Constitution may be amended by special resolution of members at a general meeting, with prior
                    notice provided to all members and a clear transitional framework for any changes affecting
                    existing rights or obligations.
                </p>

                <p class="muted small">This is a summary constitution for illustrative purposes. The full Aegis Group
                    Constitution is available on request and will be provided to applicants as part of the onboarding
                    process.</p>
